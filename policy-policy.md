# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when using our app, which provides real-time public data related to Polkadex's order book, market insights, trading charts, and wallet monitoring.

By using our app, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

## Data Collection

Our app provides access to publicly available data and offers the following features:

- **Polkadex Orderbook Data**: Real-time data related to market orders, recent trades, market insights, and trading charts.
- **Wallet Monitoring**: If you choose to add a wallet address, we will display:
  - Wallet balance
  - Open orders
  - Order history
  - Transfer history
  - Cross-chain history (if available)
  - Crowdloan contributions and rewards (if applicable)

Please note, **all data shown by the app is public information**, and the app only provides monitoring capabilities. We do not collect any personal data, and you are not required to provide any information to use the app.

## Secure Wallet Storage

If you choose to add a wallet address for monitoring, **the wallet address is stored securely in the app’s secure storage**. This secure storage is used exclusively to store the wallet address in an encrypted format to provide you with the monitoring features of the app.

- The wallet address is stored **locally** in your device’s secure storage (not on our servers).
- **No other personal or sensitive data** related to the wallet is stored by the app.
- The wallet data is encrypted and used only for the purpose of displaying public data related to that wallet.

### What We Do Not Do

- We do not store any sensitive personal information such as names, emails, or passwords.
- We do not share any wallet addresses or user-related data with third parties.
- We do not allow any data to be used for marketing or advertising purposes.

## Use of Sentry for Error Tracking

We use **Sentry** to help monitor and fix errors that may occur in the app. Sentry is a third-party service that provides us with error reporting and performance monitoring.

### What Data Does Sentry Collect?

- **Error Logs**: Sentry collects information about errors, including stack traces, device information, and session details, to help us identify and fix issues in the app.
- **Device Information**: Sentry may collect data about the device, such as the type of device, OS version, and app version.
- **Crash Reports**: In the event of a crash, Sentry may collect crash logs to help us improve the app’s stability and performance.

Please note that **Sentry does not collect any personal data** (such as your name, email, or wallet information). The data collected by Sentry is used solely for debugging and performance improvements of the app.

## No Trading Functionality

Our app is strictly a monitoring tool. **We do not allow any trading actions**, such as creating, modifying, or canceling orders. All functionality within the app is read-only and is intended to provide users with insights into Polkadex’s data and their wallets.

## Permissions

The app does **not** request or require any permissions that involve accessing sensitive information such as your personal contacts, camera, location, or microphone. If you choose to add a wallet address, this action is voluntary and allows the app to retrieve public information related to that wallet.

### Wallet Monitoring Feature

- **Wallet Address**: If you choose to add a wallet address, we retrieve public data related to your wallet, such as balance and transaction history. No sensitive information is stored or accessed.

## User Data and Privacy

We do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive information, such as your name, email address, or phone number. The data shown in the app, including wallet balances, transactions, and market data, is pulled from public sources and is displayed solely for informational purposes.

### What We Do Not Do

- We do not track or store any personal user data.
- We do not share any wallet addresses or user-related data with third parties.
- We do not allow any data to be used for marketing or advertising purposes.

## Data Security

While we take appropriate measures to protect your data, please note that the data shown within the app is publicly available. We do not store any sensitive personal information. If you store a wallet address, it is encrypted and securely stored on your device in local storage, not on our servers.

## Compliance with Google Play & Apple App Store Guidelines

This app complies with both **Google Play's** and **Apple App Store** privacy requirements, including:

- **Data Transparency**: We provide clear details regarding the types of data we collect and how it is used, as outlined in this privacy policy.
- **Data Use and Sharing**: We do not collect any personal or sensitive data from users. The wallet information that users voluntarily provide is used solely for monitoring purposes.
- **Data Security**: We ensure that the data (such as wallet addresses) stored locally on the device is encrypted and protected.

### Permissions and Sensitive Information

Our app does **not** request any sensitive permissions. The only data accessed is the public wallet information you voluntarily provide. The app does not request any personal data, nor does it engage in any activity that could violate Google Play or Apple App Store policies.
